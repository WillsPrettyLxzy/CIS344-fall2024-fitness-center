        <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

        <p>Members are expected to adhere to all posted rules and regulations, including those related to gym conduct, equipment use, and cleanliness. Failure to comply with these rules may result in membership termination without a refund.</p>

        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>At CIS Gym, we take your privacy seriously. We collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number, and payment information only for the purpose of managing your membership, processing payments, and providing you with gym-related services. This information will not be shared with third parties, except as required by law or with your consent.</p>

        <p>We may occasionally send you promotional emails or updates about our services. You may opt out of these communications at any time by contacting us or following the unsubscribe instructions in our emails.</p>

        <h2>Liability Waiver</h2>
        <p>By using CIS Gymâ€™s facilities, you acknowledge that physical exercise carries inherent risks, including the risk of serious injury or death. CIS Gym and its staff are not responsible for injuries sustained during the use of gym equipment, participation in exercise classes, or during any other activity on our premises.</p>

        <p>All members are required to sign a waiver of liability before using our facilities. You agree that you use the gym and participate in activities at your own risk. We recommend consulting with a healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise regimen.</p>

        <h2>Membership Agreement</h2>

        <p>CIS Gym reserves the right to change membership fees, services, or benefits at any time. We will notify members of any changes via email or posting within the gym. Membership fee changes will take effect at the next billing cycle following the notification.</p>

        <h2>Health and Safety Policy</h2>
        <p>The health and safety of our members and staff are of utmost importance. CIS Gym maintains high standards of cleanliness and hygiene. We ask that all members wipe down equipment after use and practice good hygiene, especially when using shared equipment.</p>

        <p>If you are feeling unwell, please refrain from attending the gym until you are fully recovered. We reserve the right to restrict access to any individual showing signs of illness, and our staff has the authority to enforce this policy.</p>

        <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>In the event of a dispute related to your membership, services, or these legal policies, you agree to first attempt to resolve the issue directly with CIS Gym management. If the dispute cannot be resolved informally, you agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable laws of the jurisdiction where the gym is located.</p>
